In May 2014, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Math (Statistics emphasis) with a music minor from the University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire. I had three actuarial exams finished, and a job offer in hand from an actuarial education company in a state in which I knew no one. 

Five years later, I'm now back in the general location where I had tried to get a job since graduating with the Bachelor's degree.
