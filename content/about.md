The blog is built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with the [XMin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), both created by Yihui Xie. Many thanks to Xie for creating extremely useful products with his work with RStudio, and for writing extremely clear documentation. I remember using knitr for the first time in my first semester of graduate school and haven't looked back.

I (Yeng Miller-Chang) am currently a Research Analysis Specialist at Normandale Community College in Bloomington, MN, while also being enrolled as a graduate student in the M.S. Statistics program at Iowa State University. I graduated with a B.S. Mathematics (Statistics emphasis) from the University of Wisconsin -- Eau Claire in 2014. Since I graduated in 2014, I've lived in three states (Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota) and have had the opportunity to work in industries such as life insurance, electronic health records, and marketing, with the bulk of my professional experience in education (actuarial, K-12, and higher education).

One of my primary philosophies is that there is no use for me to learn something if I have no intent on sharing it with others. This blog serves as a venue for me to share knowledge regarding what I've learned when it comes to mathematics, statistics, and maybe the occasional music post.
